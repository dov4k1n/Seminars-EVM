J. K. Rowling owns Harry Potter, and no one owns the methods of rationality.

Blah blah disclaimer blah blah Rowling blah blah ownership.

All these worlds are J. K. Rowling's, except Europa. Attempt no fanfics there.

Hail the Dark Lord Rowling.

Any sufficiently advanced J. K. Rowling is indistinguishable from magic.

Blood for the blood god! Skulls for J. K. Rowling!

Rowling is whoever does Rowling's job.

Whatever can go Rowling will go Rowling.
